## Abstract
> Make a React application for translating text to sign language, with login-page, translate-page and a page for profile-history.

> Part of the Noroff fullstack .NET accelerate module.

## Download and run
You can download the code with ```bash== git clone (this url) ```. If you want to run the app in a browser, just click the following link: [https://lost-in-translation-pi.vercel.app/](https://lost-in-translation-pi.vercel.app/). The app was deployed and is hosted by [vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Functionality
The following pages are available, with described GUI options:
1. Login: Login with your name. 
2. Translate: Translate words or sentences into sign language. The Americal Sign Language (ASL) is used, which means the app excludes any letters *not* included in the American alphabet. You can also toggle to profile history, or log out. 
3. Profile History: See the last 10 translations in your profile, clean history and/or logout.
